`HTML5` `JQuery` `Bootstrap`

## About

This is a knock-off of [Hacker News]('https://news.ycombinator.com/'). Hacker News is a social news website run by [Y-Combinator]('https://www.ycombinator.com/'). Users post stories mostly related to computer science and entrepreneurship. However, the stories for this project, Hack-or-Snooze, come from an API built by my [Rithm School]('https://www.rithmschool.com/') instructors and data is populated by the most recent cohort of students so they don't always make much sense.

To view the site and play the game go [here](http://hackorsnooze.kelleysharp.me.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/).
